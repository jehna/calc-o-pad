## Local development

This project is developed using Flutter, so you can run the app in your browser by running:

```shell
flutter run -d chrome \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_API_KEY=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_APP_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...
```

This downloads all the dependencies and runs the app in your browser.

You'll need to create your own Firebase project and get the API keys from there.

### Building

To build the app, run:

```shell
flutter build web \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_API_KEY=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_APP_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=... \
    --dart-define=FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=...
```

This will create a `build/web` directory with the app.

### Deploying

At the moment deployments are handled automatically by Netlify.
